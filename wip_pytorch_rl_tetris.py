## ---- Using PyTorch and reinforcement learning to play Tetris

# Using PyTorch and reinforcement learning to create an agent that plays Tetris is an exciting project! It combines a deep learning framework (PyTorch) with reinforcement learning (RL) to train an agent capable of learning strategies for the game. Here’s a high-level guide on how you can structure your project:

# ### 1. **Game Environment Setup (Tetris)**
# You’ll need an environment where your agent can play Tetris. This could be a custom implementation of Tetris or an existing environment. A good option is using `gym` or building a custom environment compatible with `gym`.

# #### Example of a Tetris environment:
# - You can start by looking for Tetris environments that have already been created, such as `gym-tetris`. You could install it like this:
#   ```bash
#   pip install gym-tetris
#   ```

# #### Custom Tetris environment:
# - If you're building your own environment, you need to define the states (current board configuration), actions (moving and rotating pieces), and rewards (positive rewards for clearing lines, negative for losing).

# ### 2. **Reinforcement Learning Approach**
# You will use RL to teach the agent how to play the game by maximizing the reward it gets. The core idea is to find a strategy (or policy) that helps the agent make decisions based on the game state.

# Here are common RL algorithms used for such tasks:
# - **Q-Learning / Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: One of the most popular approaches for RL in discrete action spaces.
# - **Policy Gradient Methods**: Like REINFORCE or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which directly optimize the policy.
#
# #### Example with DQN:
# DQN is a value-based method where you approximate a Q-function using a neural network. The goal is to predict the value of actions in a given state and update the network to maximize rewards.

# ```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import gym
import random
import numpy as np

# Neural network for approximating Q-values
class DQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(DQN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 128)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(128, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

# Initialize the environment
env = gym.make('Tetris-v0')  # Replace with your Tetris environment

# Hyperparameters
input_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]  # Size of the state space
output_dim = env.action_space.n  # Number of actions (e.g., move left, right, rotate, etc.)
learning_rate = 0.001
gamma = 0.99  # Discount factor for future rewards

# Initialize network and optimizer
model = DQN(input_dim, output_dim)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Sample random batch of experience
state = env.reset()
state = torch.FloatTensor(state).unsqueeze(0)  # Batch dimension
q_values = model(state)

# Assume we know the best action and reward
best_action = random.choice(range(output_dim))
reward = 1  # Example reward
next_state, _, done, _ = env.step(best_action)  # Take action

if done:
    target_q = reward
else:
    next_q_values = model(torch.FloatTensor(next_state).unsqueeze(0))
    target_q = reward + gamma * torch.max(next_q_values)

# Calculate loss and update network
loss = loss_fn(q_values[0, best_action], target_q)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
# ```

# ### 3. **State Representation**
# The state in Tetris is typically the current configuration of the game board (a grid with the positions of the blocks) and the current falling piece. You might represent it as a binary grid (e.g., 1 for occupied spaces, 0 for empty spaces) and the type of the falling piece.

# ### 4. **Action Space**
# Your action space could include:
# - Moving the piece left, right, or down
# - Rotating the piece
# - Dropping the piece

# ### 5. **Reward Function**
# Designing the reward function is crucial in reinforcement learning. Possible rewards in Tetris could include:
# - Positive reward for clearing lines (more reward for multiple lines cleared at once).
# - Negative reward for pieces placed in high rows or for losing the game.

# Example reward scheme:
# ```python
if lines_cleared > 0:
    reward += lines_cleared * 100
if game_lost:
    reward -= 500
# ```

# ### 6. **Training**
# - Use the RL algorithm to train your agent over thousands of games.
# - During training, you’ll explore different actions (exploration) but also start exploiting the learned policy as the model improves.

# You can use libraries like `tensorboard` for visualizing training progress (e.g., reward over time).

# ### 7. **Evaluation and Improvements**
# Once trained, you can evaluate the performance of your agent and improve it by tweaking the model architecture, reward function, and hyperparameters.

# Would you like more details on any of these steps, such as a deeper dive into a specific RL algorithm or guidance on the Tetris environment setup?
